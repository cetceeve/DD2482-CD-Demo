# Server

## Python üêç

First we decide to implement our server with the **_Flask_** framework.

- The [**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/) framework is a lightweight **_Python_** framework

### Our project structure

File structure for the server

```cmd
- /src
    - /templates
        - index.html
    - flaskServer.py
```

Quick links:

- [templates](./templates/)
- [index.html](./templates/index.html)
- [flaskServer.py](./flaskServer.py)

## flaskServer.py üñ•Ô∏è

In this file we develop our Flask server.

The interesting part in this file is that we used the **flask_cors**.

### CORS ‚ùî

(Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).

Browsers now restrict web pages from making requests to a different domains than the one that served the web page, unless the server explicitly allows it, we can think that this not an error but a security measure to secure users or the website which you are accessing from a potential security breach. To resolve this issue, we can use the Flask-CORS package to enable CORS to our Flask server.
[**CORS**](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/how-to-guides/understanding-and-resolving-cors-error/)

Now to use CORS in our Flask code we just needed to install the CORS package using the following command:

```cmd
pip install Flask-CORS
```

### ServerCode üìë

```python
from flask_cors import CORS
# ...
CORS(app)
```

With this two lines we implement the CORS package in our code.

```python
@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')


@app.route('/get_url', methods=['GET'])
def get_url():
    google_url = "https://www.google.com"
    return jsonify({"url": google_url})
```

We define two methods.

- index()
- get_url()

**index()**

So to run our code and overall html with the Flask we need to create the directory templates (_example name_), and then use the **_render_template()_** function. We also add the rout path **'/'**, and when is accessed the Server just renders the **index.html** file in the templates directory.

**get_url()**

Here we just hard code a URL in this case *www.google.com* and just return the URL.

## index.html üåê

In the **index.html** file we implement a client with a button where the user can click it and send a get request to the server. So to take the **URL** of the server.

We used XMLHttpRequest object to send a GET requests to our Flask server.

```javascript
            const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
            xhr.onreadystatechange = function() {
                if (this.readyState === 4 && this.status === 200) {
                    const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);
                    window.location.href = data.url;

```

1. We listens for changes in the request's state, and when the request is completed means:
   - **(readyState === 4) and (status === 200)**
     both should be successful,
2. it parses the JSON response
   - **const data = JSON.parse(this.responseText);**
3. redirects the browser to the received URL
   - **window.location.href = data.url;**.

#### XML HttpRequest

The XMLHttpRequest object can be used to request data from a web server. Like our web server.
